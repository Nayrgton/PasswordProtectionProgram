\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document is a rigorous guideline that encompasses the testing, validation and verification processes that the software, PasswordProectionProgram, shall undergo.

\subsection{Scope}
This test plan will be used as a outline for unit testing the encryption of user information, the GUI and the database used to store the user data. This is to facilitate the identification of software bugs in each specific section and to allow the testing to be done by each group member. These components will also be integration tested to verify that the system as a whole functions as intended.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

Testing for Proof of Concept will be unit and structural test what will be used for a Proof of Concept demo. These tests are to test the functionality of the program. The areas that the proof of concept testing will focus on are User Interface, Encryption and Database.

\subsection{Master Password}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{POC-1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: GUI is run for the first time

Input: A valid password is entered under Master Password

Output: User is brought to the password management screen

How test will be performed: For the proof of concept, the master password will not be saved in the database or encrypted as those are independent during the POC. Instead, a function that checks password logic will allow the screen to update to the next screen if password criteria is satisfied

\item{POC-2\\}
					
Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: GUI is run for the second time after master password is initialized

Input: The correct password is entered under Master Password

Output: User is brought to password management screen

How test will be performed: For the proof of concept, the master password from before will be saved and upon execution for the second time and forwards, it will proceed only if the user types in the correct password

\item{POC-3\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: Password management screen

Input: Valid account information is entered for type, username and password

Output: Entry appears as label on screen 

How test will be performed: For the proof of concept, the input is checked for criteria satisfaction (is the password not null), if these requirements are satisfied, the entry is displayed on the GUI frame

\item{POC-4\\}

Type: Unit, Dynamic, Automated

Initial State: Encryption function is called

Input: Any string

Output: String gets encrypted

How test will be performed: The encrypted string will be printed to check if it is encrypted

\item{POC-5\\}

Type: Unit, Dynamic, Automated

Initial State: Decryption function is called

Input: An already encrypted string

Output: String gets decrypted

How test will be performed: The decrypted string will be printed to see if it matches the original string that was encrypted

\item{POC-6\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: Connection to database has not been established

Input: Connect to database (Database.Connect())

Output: Can print contents through command line

How test will be performed: For the proof of concept, the database is independent of the GUI and encryption method. For this reason, after the connection is established, it can be verified by printing the table contents through the command line

\item{POC-7\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: Connection to database has been established

Input: Insert into database

Output: New content shows up when printing through command line

How test will be performed: For the proof of concept, the database is independent of the GUI and encryption method. For this reason, on insertion of data, it can be checked that the data was indeed inserted by printing the table contents through the command line

\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
				
The existing implementation, Padlock, which our implementation is based on, is very similar in nature in terms of user interface. Therefore, the main areas of testing that can be compared to the existing product are user input and navigation. These tests will be valuable in improving the product and testing parallely to see what our implementation lacks or could do differently. Relevant test cases that can be used for comparison are:\\

\end{description}

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
		
Unit testing will be executed using PyUnit and all functions of the application will be tested. In functional requirements there are few unit tests because the tests are heavily focused on user interface. However, to test that internal functions work as expected, the following tests will be executed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{checkPassword(password)} - checks if the password satisfies criteria
    \item \texttt{insert(id, type, username, password)} - inserts id of entry, type, username and encrypted password
    \item \texttt{\sout{updateMasterPassword} \textcolor{blue}{updateU(id, new)}} - updates master password in database if it is modified    
    \item \texttt{\sout{username(id)} \textcolor{blue}{getId(id)}} - returns \sout{username} \textcolor{blue}{query} from database
    \item \texttt{\sout{password(id)}} - \sout{returns password from database, which is later decrypted}
    \item \texttt{copy(id)} - gets password at specific id, decrypts it and returns
    \item \texttt{\sout{generateRand()} \textcolor{blue}{genPassCrypt()}} - generates a random password
    \item \texttt{generKey()} - generates key for encryption
    \item \texttt{cryptEncode(key f, String password)} - encrypts input password using Fernet key
    \item \texttt{\sout{decrypt} \textcolor{blue}{cryptDecode}(\textcolor{blue}{key f}, String encryptedPassword)} - decrypts encrypted password using key
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		

Below is a description of the output files that will be needed for unit testing and how the functions that are being unit tested will use the output files. Not all functions require an output file for unit testing. Coverage metrics are also discussed.\\

\texttt{passwords.txt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{passwords.txt} will have a list of passwords that may or may not satisfy password criteria 
    \item At the end of the file there will be a Boolean array that tells you if the passwords satisfy the criteria or not
    \item Used for checkPassword() to test if passwords are being evaluated correctly. Coverage metric will be comparison of unit test output to the Boolean array at the end of file
    \item Used for updateMasterPassword() to change master password consecutively.
    \item Used for generKey(), cryptEncode(key f, String password), decrypt(String encryptedPassword) to encrypt and decrypt passwords
\end{itemize}

\texttt{tuples.csv}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Will have records to be inserted into the database
    \item used for insert(id, type, username, password) to insert into database
    \item used for username(id) and password(id) to have something in database to return
    \item Used for copy(id) to see if each password entry gets copied
\end{itemize}

\texttt{copies.txt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The output file which will be compared to all password entries in tuples.csv
    \item Used for copy(id) to check if the passwords in tuples.csv were copied correctly to copies.txt
\end{itemize}

\texttt{generated1.txt} and \texttt{generated2.txt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used for generateRand() in which both files will be filled with generated passwords and the coverage metric will be to verify how similar the two are. This will be loosely done by comparing each line in generated1.txt to all lines in generated2.txt. Fewest similarities are ideal 
\end{itemize}
