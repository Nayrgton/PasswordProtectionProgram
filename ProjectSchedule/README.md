This folder contains the project schedule Gantt Chart.
The Gantt Chart was first created with expected timelines for each task.
With each deliverable deadline, the Gantt is modified to match the actual 
task timelines and submitted as a pdf.

The final Gantt Chart should reflect the true timelines of the project 
not the initial estimated ones.
