Team Name: Tuples1

Team Members: Joseph Lu, Shabana Dhayananth, Suhavi Sandhu

## Installation

To start using the password manager, make sure you download the PPP.zip file (it's in the root folder!).
Extract the file, go into the PPP folder and run PPP.exe :+1:

Please note that while we tested our application on all Windows, Mac and Linux - we only got the chance to
test the executable for Windows :( So we advise running our application on Windows.
